# Hello, I'm Alexandra Johnson (She/Her)

### UI/UX Designer & Front-End Developer based in Berlin, Germany üá©üá™

I'm a passionate creator living at the intersection of design and code. For me, design isn't just about aesthetics; it's about crafting intuitive, accessible, and delightful digital experiences. I thrive on turning complex problems into beautiful, user-centric solutions. My process is a constant dance between creative exploration and technical precision, where I experiment with motion, typography, and illustration to bring ideas to life.
